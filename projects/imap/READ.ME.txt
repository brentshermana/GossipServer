 Note: Since this assignment is not a formal project milestone and does not
 require a DOCUMENTATION.pdf file with all of the sections and details
 contained therein, and the assignment description does not ask for or
 require one, we did not create or include one because we also did not feel
 that one would be necessary for this assignment.  If one was required, and
 it would still be helpful to have one created after the assignment
 submission, let us know and we will create one.  However, since there is
 no DOCUMENTATION.pdf file, one quick note on the assignment implementation
 is included here.
 
 Notes on implementation:

- username and password are both passed through the command line
- We accept username arguments in both the format 'user' and 'user@domain.com'
	The option without @domain.com only works if the imap server name
	obeys the convention "imap.domain.*"
- Neither the username nor the password should be enclosed in quotes.
	Passwords may contain no whitespace other than singular internal
	spaces, otherwise they will not be parsed correctly
- regarding the -f option, Apache Commons CLI allows an option to have
	multiple arguments, so we decided to use this feature. The preferred
	method for using the -f option is "-f f1 f2 f3", rather than
	"-f f1 -f f2 ...", but both should work
